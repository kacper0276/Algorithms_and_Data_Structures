# Algorithms and Data Structures Project

This project is a demonstration of various algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. It showcases fundamental concepts in computer science through practical examples. The project includes implementations of key algorithms such as binary tree traversal and sorting algorithms, providing insight into their behavior and efficiency.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Traversal**: Includes algorithms for traversing binary trees such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements common sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Search Algorithms**: Features search algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search to find elements efficiently.
- **Data Structures**: Implements various data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
- **Many more**: And many other algorithms

## Technologies

### Language

- **C#**: The primary language used for implementing algorithms and data structures. C# provides a strong type system and object-oriented capabilities that are leveraged in this project.


### Data Structures

- **Linked Lists**: Includes singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Implements stack operations using linked lists and arrays.
- **Queues**: Provides implementations for both circular and simple queues.
